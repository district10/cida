# Functional QA

## Release contract

Cida's release decision is based on one signed Release `.app`, not on a Debug preview build. The
artifact manifest records the source commit, clean state, Developer ID signature, executable digest,
and complete app-tree digest. Swift tests, Tart XCUI, mutation contracts, and performance runners
consume that artifact or the same source commit, and the final gate verifies the app-tree digest
again.

The current core experience contract (`Design/spec/panel.md`) includes:

1. A menu-bar application whose main interface is one borderless, non-activating floating panel:
   the global shortcut (`Option-A` unless another one was recorded in Settings) shows or hides it without taking focus from the application the user came from,
   Escape and clicking outside hide it, and hiding never loses the source, the result, or a running
   request.
2. Real native typing, selection, paste, multiline growth, deletion-driven shrink, and Return
   submit in the source pane, with the panel exactly as tall as its content: the source pane is
   capped at 30% of the screen, the panel at 70%, and both panes scroll past their caps.
3. One result at a time. Return runs the selected action on the current source, keeps the source
   in the editor, and replaces the previous result immediately. Every appearance of the panel
   selects the first saved action without changing the source selection; explicit capture and translation-layer commands still translate.
4. Delayed-first-byte, bursty, character-at-a-time, paused, stopped, failed, and recovered
   OpenAI-compatible streaming, rendered with display-linked smoothing, bounded grapheme batches,
   the per-run 120 ms glyph reveal behind the caret, the waiting caret, coalesced TextKit
   natural-height publication, and the 150 ms height slide for pane and panel growth.
5. A control bar with the ordered saved actions (Tab cycles through them) and one context slot: `停止`
   while a request runs, `复制结果` once a result exists, `✓ 已复制` for 800 ms after copying.
6. Result notes instead of alerts: an edited source or a changed action dims the result and notes
   `原文已修改 · ⏎ 重新生成`; a stopped request keeps its partial text with `已停止`; a failed
   request explains itself inline and Return retries.
7. Native Command-C precedence: a selection keeps the system copy; without one, Command-C copies
   the result.
8. A generic model configuration (endpoint; Chat Completions, Responses or Anthropic Messages;
   model; auth header; extra headers and body) set through the command line by an AI assistant
   from the prompt Settings copies, with the key read from stdin, a file or an environment
   variable into Keychain and `check` sending one real request; Settings shows the status, a check
   and the prompt. Also prompt edit/reset, source-language detection, and source-language-
   preserving improvement, in a fixed-width Settings window whose height follows its content.
   Settings saved by 1.0 (provider presets) load as the equivalent configuration.
9. Input-method safety: the SwiftUI binding is never written back into the editor while a
   composition (for example pinyin) is in progress, the placeholder hides as soon as marked text
   appears, and Escape, Tab, and the other panel shortcuts reach the input method first while it
   composes.
10. Exact one-million-character input in the isolated performance workload.

Production starts empty and without mock output. Automation redirects only its preferences,
Keychain namespace, local endpoint, and diagnostics; it does not replace the production model,
panel, or renderer paths.

## Root repairs in the panel rewrite

| Risk | Root repair | Regression oracle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The history timeline consumed most of the code and its interaction never converged | The timeline, folding, SQLite persistence, virtualized list, and their gates are removed. `AppModel` holds one `ResultRecord`; the panel shows source, control bar, and result. | The whole suite runs against the panel; `PairwiseManifestTests` keeps every UI suite in the PR gate. |
| A fixed window left dead space and a chat-style bottom composer | `PanelController` sizes a non-activating `NSPanel` from the height its SwiftUI content reports, anchored at the top edge, within a screen-relative budget. | Panel style-mask, content-height, fixed-top-edge, and height-budget tests; XCUI growth/shrink and hide/show journeys. |
| Pinyin composition was cancelled by SwiftUI write-backs | `ComposerTextEditor.updateNSView` skips the binding write-back while the text view has marked text (found by the panel IME spike). | `testBindingWriteBackIsSkippedWhileAnInputMethodIsComposing`. |
| The source pane did not shrink after deletions | The source height is measured from TextKit 2 layout fragments after every native edit instead of the lazily updated usage bounds. | Composer shrink test with exact 78/52/27 pt heights and the matching panel heights; XCUI growth/shrink journey. |
| A completed result opened scrolled to its end | A replaced document is scrolled to its top, and the result scroll view follows the tail only while streaming. | Height-budget test and the long-input indicator test assert `contentView.bounds.minY == 0`. |
| A long streaming result carried the reader to its end (user report, 2026-09-30) | The pane followed the tail by default, and every throttled stream update re-attached the follow, so scrolling up snapped back within 50 ms. The model's follow revision is gone: `ResultScrollView` starts every document at its top and follows the tail only after the user scrolls to the end of a result that has outgrown the pane. | `testStreamingResultDoesNotBounceWhileThePaneGrows` rejects any scroll while the result streams below the fold; `testStreamingResultFollowsItsTailOnceTheUserScrollsThere` scrolls to the end and expects the pane to follow. |
| A result stopped at its start looked finished: the pane cuts at a whole line and the overlay scroll bar is hidden at rest | Each edge with text beyond it fades the ink to 4% over 58 pt (`result-fade`), as deep as the hidden text, drawn by `ResultEdgeFadeView` over the clip view and under the scroll bar. | `testALongResultFadesTheEdgesWithTextBeyondThem` checks each fade's depth and edge at the start, near both ends and at the end, and that the last visible line is painted fainter than a middle line. |
| A stale result could be copied as if current | `isResultStale` compares source length and text and the action against the record; the note row states what ⏎ will do. | `testEditedSourceMarksTheResultStale`, property test stale parity, XCUI stale note. |
| The whole panel bobbed on every new line while a result grew | Two causes. The hosting view filled the panel's content view, so while the window animated its height SwiftUI re-centred the content on every step (the source pane rose by half the growth and slid back); the hosting view is now pinned to the top at its final height and the container clips what the window has not revealed. Separately, `ResultScrollView` scrolled to the tail before the pane had grown and the clip view snapped back; it now follows the tail only once the pane has reached its cap (`maxVisibleHeight`). | `testStreamingResultDoesNotBounceWhileThePaneGrows` samples the source pane's distance from the panel top, the scroll offset, and the panel height every 8 ms and rejects any drift or reversal. |
| The scroll bars were a custom 4 pt indicator that ignored the system preference | Both panes use the system overlay scroll bar (decided 2026-09-23). The result scroll view spans the pane and `ResultTextContainer` insets its text column, so both bars share the panel's right edge; the custom indicator and its scroller suppression are gone. | `testLongInputAndResultScrollWithSystemScrollBarsOnOneEdge` asserts native scrollers on both scroll views, both reaching the panel edge, and the 28 pt text inset. |
| The panel showed transparent in the signed Release build | `PanelController.show()` faded the panel in through `NSWindow.animator().alphaValue`, which never progressed in the Release guest; the panel is ordered front at full opacity instead. Only production and the Tart launch reach `show()` (design snapshots use `prepareAutomationPanel`). | Every XCUI journey (the panel must exist), plus the per-launch lifecycle log that records the panel's alpha on show. |

## Test layers

| Layer | Environment | Current role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State | Swift XCTest | model transitions, typed request envelope, deterministic property sequences, report validation |
| Native components | AppKit XCTest | responder chain, TextKit append/layout, panel sizing, indicators, background windows |
| Release E2E | fresh headless Tart clone | real signed app, WindowServer, XCUI input, local SSE, screenshots, accessibility |
| Mutation | temporary clean clone | deliberately reintroduce known faults; designated unit and Release tests must fail |
| Performance | nonactivating physical-display runner | display-link cadence, main-actor latency, missed budgets, exact workloads, RSS and artifact digest |

The host Swift suite contains 101 tests: 47 model/report tests, 33 native interaction and layout
tests, 6 mutation invariants, 4 host isolation tests, 4 design-token tests, 3 loopback integration
tests, 2 suite/matrix manifest tests, and 2 deterministic journey-model tests.

The Release XCUI target contains 18 tests across seven files: 15 product journeys and three harness
self-tests. The product journeys cover signed-artifact smoke, composer growth and shrink, submit
with the source retained, stale marking, improvement in both languages, Command-C precedence,
controlled and uneven streams, result replacement, stop/failure/recovery, the shared state-machine
smoke with hide and show, the panel lifecycle and Settings, and the empty-panel and Settings pixel
baselines with the accessibility audit.

## Test-system self-verification

All UI waits use one 20 ms polling primitive that samples immediately, records value transitions,
and attaches its timeline to the XCResult on timeout. Three deterministic harness tests use an
injectable clock to prove that 100 ms, 200 ms, and 800 ms transient states are observable and that a
timeout retains its changed-value history. Tart failures write a machine-readable classification as
`infrastructure`, `build`, `source-test`, `ui-assertion-or-crash`, or `artifact`; an ambiguous UI
failure is never automatically labeled as a product regression. Every XCUI launch also writes a
panel lifecycle log (`lifecycle/<namespace>.log`, via `--automation-lifecycle-log`) with the
activation policy, app activation, and the panel's visibility, key status, alpha, and frame at
launch, on every show, and on every key-window transition, because none of that is observable
through accessibility for a non-activating panel.

The mutation catalog contains eight source-level faults. Each definition pins an exact source
anchor and names its unit and Release kill tests. Catalog drift fails before an expensive build
or VM launch: the anchor must occur exactly once, and every named kill test must be declared in the
test sources. A targeted `swift test --filter` that matches no test case is reported as
`infrastructure`, never as a killed or survived mutation. The faults cover the redraw policy of the
result layer, a replaced result keeping its old text, a submission keeping the previous record, a
stale result never being marked, the action not resetting on show, the source pane never resizing,
Command-C ignoring a native selection, and improvement reusing translation languages.

The checked-in pairwise manifest provides a stable inventory of light/dark, reduced motion,
scrollbar preference, action, content, and display combinations, and its pair coverage is
mathematically verified. It is not executed as separate Tart configurations, so it must not be
presented as a completed environment matrix.

## Isolation contract

Tart clones `cida-ui-golden`, randomizes the clone MAC, disables graphics, audio, host clipboard,
and guest Ethernet, mounts source read-only, and exposes only a writable artifact directory. App
assertion failures are never retried. A failed VM boot may receive one fresh-clone retry; a broken
golden image must be reinitialized instead of repaired in place.

A 100 ms host monitor tracks the two exact artifact executable paths. The run fails if either is
launched or becomes frontmost on the host, if the monitor dies, or if sample coverage has a gap.
Normal user changes to the host frontmost app, clipboard, or independently running production Cida
are recorded as diagnostics rather than misclassified as test activity.

## Current verification

- `swift test -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`: 103/103 passed on the host.
- Tart XCUI suite: see the runs recorded below.
- Mutation catalog: all 8 anchors validate (`run-mutation-contracts.sh --mode catalog`), and
  `--mode unit` kills all 8 in temporary clean clones (7 of 8 on commit 0f83f03; the eighth,
  `improvement-reuses-translation-source-language`, did not compile until its replacement text
  followed the typed `Language` fields and was killed on commit 7b418ff). Results directories:
  `TestResults/panel-mutations-20260923` and `TestResults/panel-mutations-20260923-fix`; all 8
  killed again on the Settings redesign commit 805366e (`TestResults/settings-mutations-20260923`).

### Lifecycle run on released builds, 2026-09-25

The whole path of `Design/spec/lifecycle.md` on the builds users get, in a networked clone of
`cida-ui-golden` at 1512 × 982 pt. The guest screen was read and clicked through Tart's
`--vnc-experimental` server (with `--no-graphics`, so nothing opens on the host), because
`screencapture` and `osascript` started through tart-guest-agent are denied by TCC.

- `v1.1.0-rc.3` (1.1.0, build 145) from R2, quarantined as a browser download: the DMG opened as
  the paper window with 辞达 and 应用程序 on their marks; Gatekeeper named the app 辞达 and reported
  it notarized. Finder counted the title bar in the window height and cut the background's bottom
  off; `v1.1.0` makes the window 30 pt taller (checked on the released DMG).
- The first launch found rc.4 at once and showed the update panel; 稍后 left 安装新版本 1.1.0… in
  the menu bar, and the next open showed the welcome.
- An assistant's configuration (`Cida config set api-key --stdin`, `config set endpoint=… model=…`)
  removed the welcome from the open panel at once. No Keychain prompt appeared then, after the
  update, or when the updated app and its command line read the key.
- From the menu item: update found, download progress, 已准备好, 立即重启. `/Applications/Cida.app`
  became build 146, notarized, relaunched into the menu bar without the panel, and opened to the
  configured panel. rc.4 later received the `v1.1.0` release (build 147) with its notes.
- The run found the notes unclear (no heading, developer wording) and 1.1.0 over 1.1.0 between
  candidates; `v1.1.0` adds 更新内容, rewrites the notes and shows builds for equal versions.

### Tart XCUI run `shortcut-tart-20260924c`

19 of 19 tests passed with the recordable global shortcut (artifact digest
`0040f520bb56631d5e166707285e54d39ba5cfe577edb734ae3d65ee4c6ce528`, host suite 105/105). The new
journey records ⌃⌥T in Settings, checks that ⌥Space no longer shows the panel while ⌃⌥T does, and
restores the default. Two earlier runs on the same feature failed for test-side reasons: XCUI reads
the chip's accessibility label rather than its text, and a fixed ⌥Space key equivalent in the SwiftUI
main menu kept answering while Cida was active (the command is gone; the hot key and the menu bar
item follow the recorded shortcut).

### Tart XCUI run `count-tart-20260923`

18 of 18 tests passed after the source pane's character count was removed (artifact digest
`4690f1001365ee8fc588eddfce5b385573145102b586701d17106388bae3539a`, host suite 101/101). The
`long` design state was re-captured; every other state capture is byte-identical.

### Tart XCUI run `overlay-tart-20260923`

18 of 18 tests passed with the scroll bars pinned to the overlay style (`OverlayScrollView`; artifact
digest `a9532fc1f5c102c192a40a1497174f354a26c61845656e5f676bb26262593ed2`, host suite 101/101).
Letting the bars follow the system preference gave the user's Mac, which has a mouse attached, the
legacy track in every pane; the guest no longer narrows the result column either.

### Tart XCUI run `scrollbars-tart-20260923c`

18 of 18 tests passed with the system scroll bars (app-tree digest
`024088ccace72277c404b5c67b296325c00d2cb792fcb80bff6a2a7c0895e078`, host suite 101/101). The
guest uses the legacy scroller style, so the result column is 16 pt narrower there than with
overlay scroll bars; the column re-wraps to whatever width the scroll view leaves it.

### Tart XCUI run `settings-tart-20260923f`

18 of 18 tests passed against the artifact that pins the panel content to the top edge while
the window animates (app-tree digest
`64e20fadd8a99caf7b4ca8d9ca7238184603c3d241c45dfd15063530658fab8b`, host suite 104/104). The
lifecycle log now records every window resize with the content and hosting frames, which is how
the re-centring was found: the hosting view sits at its final height while the window's content
view grows underneath it.

### Tart XCUI run `settings-tart-20260923b`

18 of 18 tests passed against the artifact with the result-pane repairs (app-tree digest
`477644d0fbd0fa2a40425c6639afc9bc2c33b28bf282cdf2a8169975dc6f6013`, host suite 104/104).

### Tart XCUI run `settings-tart-20260923a`

18 of 18 tests passed in a fresh headless Tart clone (macOS 26.4 guest, Xcode 26.5) against
the signed Release artifact built from the Settings redesign tree (app-tree digest
`d9f2d15962a6a58b3dd8a255f23058b1474b7e226cd63906ee0d0aa2e6234b84`), after the guest's own
`swift test` (103/103); the host session guard passed. The settings journey now covers the preset
menu, the endpoint caption, the readiness line in all four states, the collapsed prompts, the
custom endpoint with a typed model, and the local-endpoint key placeholder; the Settings pixel
baseline is the 560 × 616 default state of `States — 设置`. Results directory:
`TestResults/settings-tart-20260923a`.

### Tart XCUI run `panel-tart-20260923j`

18 of 18 tests passed in a fresh headless Tart clone (macOS 26.4 guest, Xcode 26.5) against
the signed Release artifact built from this tree (app-tree digest
`d7fd4dab11fcb98bfe951bad16e08d032ae61725581571e694775d8e19bc059b`), after the guest's own
`swift test` (102/102). The host session guard passed: neither artifact executable was launched or
frontmost on the host. Results directory: `TestResults/panel-tart-20260923j`.

The first runs of the rewritten suite failed as a whole before any journey ran, and the failures
were harness and product findings rather than flakes:

- `show()` faded the panel in with a window animator that never progressed in the Release guest,
  so the panel was key and ordered front at alpha 0 for the whole run (found with the lifecycle
  log, fixed in the product).
- XCUI reports the borderless `NSPanel` as a dialog, never under `windows`; the driver queries
  `dialogs["cida-panel"]`.
- An identifier on the panel's root stack was pushed by SwiftUI onto the pane containers and hid
  their own `source-pane`, `control-bar`, and `result-pane` identifiers.
- The 800 ms `✓ 已复制` state is missed by `waitForExistence`, which samples about once per
  second; the driver's 20 ms polling waiter observes it.
- The pre-first-byte pixel oracle screenshots the result pane rather than the text view (whose
  accessibility frame is the full document height), skips the rounded bottom corners where the
  desktop shows, and skips the caret column, whose faded breathing edges read as neutral ink.
- The combined note row exposes its text as the element's value, not its label.
- The accessibility audit ignores elements outside the panel's frame (the guest's Touch Bar proxy
  and menu bar).

## Performance acceptance boundary

The performance runner uses the exact manifest-bound app with activation policy `.accessory`, orders
its transparent panel behind existing windows, and fails if the app activates or the panel becomes
key. Focused gates require a detected 120 Hz display, at least 118.8 native display-link callbacks
per second, P99 and main-actor latency within the configured budget, zero missed budgets for strict
workloads, and complete workload-specific invariants.

Tart frame rate is never used as 120 Hz evidence. If only a 60 Hz display is detected, correctness
and diagnostic latency can still be reported, but physical 120 Hz certification remains pending.

## Custom actions

`ActionEditorTests` covers legacy migration, ordered persistence, draft validation and trimming,
restore-default application, deletion/undo, required translation protection, preview cancellation,
late-response rejection, failure/retry, cache invalidation after model or language changes,
unconfigured service behavior, panel-result isolation and default-action routing.

The signed-app Tart journeys in `PanelAndSettingsJourneyTests` cover:

- `testCustomActionsEditPreviewReorderAndRunInThePanel`: native creation, editing, fixed sample,
  rename without another request, drag and keyboard sorting, panel submission, deletion/undo.
  It also checks stable sample/button/adjacent-action frames when editing, absence of an empty
  output pane and retention of the previous preview.
- `testActionPreviewFailureRetryAndStopKeepThePreviousResult`: controlled HTTP failure, visible
  error, retry of the same policy, stop before the first byte, and retention of the prior output.
- `testActionDraftSurvivesSettingsClosureAndOnlyAppliedChangesSurviveRelaunch`: tab changes,
  Settings closure, persistent names/prompts/order across restart, and session-only drafts/previews.
- `testActionValidationAndOverflowKeepCreationReachable`: invalid drafts send no request, long
  names and overflowing action rails preserve window width and access to creation.
- The capture journey puts improvement first and verifies capture still translates. Selection,
  improvement replacement, translation-layer, shortcut and configuration journeys cover the
  neighboring entry points.

Preview requests use the production client against local deterministic HTTP servers. These tests
check request policy and interaction behavior, not the output quality of a remote model. Layout
assertions and screenshots cover settled geometry, not frame-by-frame animation smoothness.
